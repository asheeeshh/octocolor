## 🐱‍💻 How does GitColor work?

The idea is simple. We get the language info for all of a user's GitHub Repositories using [GhPolyGlot]('https://github.com/IonicaBizau/node-gh-polyglot) and then we use the top 2 languages as a reference to determine the color of the user's GitHub profile. Once we get the info about the top 2 languages, we blend the the colors using the [Mix CSS Color]('https://www.npmjs.com/package/mix-css-color') library. Then we simply use [Name that Color]('https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/') library to get the name of the unique color generated by the app. And we're done! 🚀
